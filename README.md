# Giter8 Template for Aggregator Methods

To use this template, you need to have [SBT][sbt] installed. Once installed, you can use it to create a new method from this template like so:

```bash
$ sbt new broadinstitute/dig-aggregator-method.g8
```

You will be prompted to fill out a few template variables. Most of these can remain the defaults (and usually should!), but the method and stage names should be your own.

This will create a new directory off your current path with the template instantiated. You can open that folder in your favorite Scala/Java editor or IDE to begin creating your new method.
